# npm resolution error report

While resolving: vite_react_shadcn_ts@0.0.0
Found: react-leaflet@5.0.0
node_modules/react-leaflet
  react-leaflet@"^5.0.0" from the root project

Could not resolve dependency:
peer react-leaflet@"^4.0.0" from react-leaflet-cluster@3.1.1
node_modules/react-leaflet-cluster
  react-leaflet-cluster@"*" from the root project

Fix the upstream dependency conflict, or retry
this command with --force or --legacy-peer-deps
to accept an incorrect (and potentially broken) dependency resolution.
